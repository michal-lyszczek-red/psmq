.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Receive single control message or message that client has subscribed to.
Functions will block calling thread until message is received.
Message will be stored in user provided memory pointed by
.IR msg .
.PP
Message is stored in
.B struct psmq_msg
which definition is:
.nf
    struct psmq_msg {
        struct ctrl {
.RI "            char  " cmd ;
.RI "            unsigned char " data ;
.RI "        } " ctrl ;
.RI "        unsigned short " paylen ;
.RI "        char " data [PSMQ_MSG_MAX];
    }
.fi
.PP
.I ctrl
structure is mostly for internal purposes and is of very little use
for user code.
.PP
.I data
contains both topic and payload data.
Topic and payload can be extracted by using
.BR PSMQ_TOPIC ()
and
.BR PSMQ_PAYLOAD ()
macros and passing
.RB struct\  psmq_msg
as argument.
.BR PSMQ_TOPIC ()
will return valid c-string with topic, while
.BR PSMQ_PAYLOAD ()
will return pointer where payload starts.
Accessing pointer returned by
.BR PSMQ_PAYLOAD ()
is only valid when
.I paylen
is bigger than 0, otherwise you risk getting
.B SIGSEGV
from OS.
.PP
.I paylen
tells the length of payload part in
.IR data
NOT size of data in whole
.I data
part.
Received message always has topic, so this part can be calculated
automatically.
.PP
.BR psmq_timedreceive (3)
works same way as
.BR psmq_receive (3)
but will block only until timeout
.I tp
occurs.
Timeout is absolute time since Epoch when timeout should occur.
If this function is called when timeout already occured
.RI ( tp
happens to be behind current time) and message is not available in queue,
function will return immediately.
.PP
.BR psmq_timedreceive_ms (3)
works same way as
.BR psmq_timedreceive (3)
but accepts relative timeout in form of
.IR ms .
If message is not received in
.I ms
time from the moment function is called, then the function will return.
If
.I ms
is set to 0 and message is not on the queue, function will return immediately.
.PP
.B _prio
versions work the same as their counterparts, but will also store priority
on which message has been sent.
This may not be supported on all Operating Systems.
If this is not supported, default value of 0 will be stored.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
When message is received 0 is returned.
On error -1 with appropriate errno set is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I psmq
or
.I msg
is
.BR NULL .
.TP
.B EBADF
Subscribe queue is invalid inside passed
.I psmq
object.
It is possible that
.I psmq
has not yet been initialized, or
.BR psmq_cleanup (3)
has been called on it earlier, or
.BR psmq_init (3)
failed.
.TP
.B EINTR
The call was interrupted by a signal handler.
.PP
.BR psmq_timedreceive (3)
and
.BR psmq_timedreceive_ms (3)
can also return:
.TP
.B ETIMEDOUT
The call timedout before a message could be transferred.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Example shows how to initialize, subscribe and receive data from psmq.
Note: error checking has been ommited for clarity.
.PP
.nf
    #include <psmq.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        struct psmq psmq;
        int rpm;
        int i;

        /* initialize psmq object that will automatically create mqueue for
         * receiving data, and will connect to default broker of name /psmqd.
         * Max items in queue is set to 10 */
        psmq_init(&psmq, 10);

        /* subscribe to receive revolution per minute information */
        psmq_subscribe(&psmq, "/can/+/rpm");

        for (i = 0; i != 10; ++i) {
            /* now we are ready to receive data. In this example we
             * simply print received rpm */
            struct psmq_msg msg;
            psmq_receive(&psmq, &msg);
            memcpy(&rpm, PSMQ_PAYLOAD(msg), sizeof(rpm));
            printf("topic: %s; rpm %d\en", PSMQ_TOPIC(msg), rpm);
        }

        /* after work is finished, we need to deregister from broker to
         * make space in broker for another client */
        psmq_cleanup(&psmq);
        return 0;
